How to run files in linux environment in order to automate the docker container deployments

a. copy all files attached to an ubuntu machine

g. The new changes will be reflected in corresponding xml files under "results" directory of container2

If there is any issue in running the files, please connect to my AWS instance - 52.211.151.45 , port: 22 , username : ubuntu
